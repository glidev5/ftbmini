You sometimes use CAPS, and sometimes not. Other culture use them, so i used them too even if you don't use them. Supposed you will correct it in /de /en
for Rich woman, i translate it in "Bourgeoise", you can change this for "Femme riche"
in the indi official, trader is translated as "Marchant" but it is "MarchanD" in fact, if you want to tell them.
Soldier is translated as "Soldat". But i have translate the "player soldier" as Legionnaire ("Légionnaire"). You can of course write it back to "Soldat" too if you wan't the exact same name for both. (or "Légionnaire" for both). Anyway, a roman soldier in french is known as a "Légionnaire".
